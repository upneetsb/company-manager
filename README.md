# company-manager

This project is my take on a company HR system. This system allows a master user (currently working on the ranking system) to perform administrative tasks on the 
employee records at the company. 

## Install Instructions

1. Clone the directory
2. Run the command 'node app.js'
3. Open the web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/
4. Play around with the features!

## Technical Description

Tech Stack
**Frontend**
1. HTML/CSS
2. Bootstrap
3. ejs
4. ReactJS

**Backend**

For the front end I used a basic Bootstrap template and wrote expressJS code to allow me to include dynamic and changing data (for example employee records) which
are consistently changing
